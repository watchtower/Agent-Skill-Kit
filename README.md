# Agent Skill Kit (ASK)

![Agent Skill Kit Banner](assets/banner.png)

**Agent Skill Kit (ASK)** is a CLI toolkit for managing, distributing, and syncing skills across multiple AI agents. It serves as a unified "package manager" for your AI's capabilities, allowing you to define a skill once and deploy it to **Gemini, Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor**, and more.

## 🧠 Why Agent Skill Kit?

Managing instructions for multiple AI agents is tedious. You often have to:
*   Copy `.cursorrules` to `.codex.md`.
*   Manually sync `~/instructions.md` with project-specific prompts.
*   Format skills differently for Gemini (`SKILL.md`) vs Claude (Slash Commands).

**ASK** solves this by treating skills as **reusable packages**.
1. **Define Once**: Write a skill in a standard format.
2. **Deploy Anywhere**: ASK transforms and copies the skill to the correct location and format for each agent.
3. **Sync**: Keep all your agents updated with a single command.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Support**: Native support for Gemini, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Antigravity, and Cursor.
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatically discovers available agents in the `agents/` directory.
- **Safe Copy**: Strictly adheres to "Do Not Overwrite". Prompts for a new name if a skill conflicts.
- **Local & Global**: Choose between **Project-Local** (specific to one repo) or **Global** (user-wide) deployment.
- **AI-Assisted Creation**: Includes meta-skills that teach your AI how to create new skills (`skill-creator`) or add new agents (`add-agent`).
- **Extensible**: Add support for any new AI agent in seconds via the `ask add-agent` wizard.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NavanithanS/Agent-Skill-Kit.git
cd Agent-Skill-Kit

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

## 🛠 Usage

### 1. Copy Skills to an Agent ⭐
**The primary way to use ASK** — Deploy skills to your AI agents using the interactive wizard.

**Interactive Mode** (Recommended):
```bash
ask copy
```
The wizard guides you through:
1. **Skill Selection**: Beautiful table showing all skills with descriptions and categories
2. **Agent Selection**: Compatible agents highlighted for your chosen skill
3. **Destination**: Choose between local (project) or global (user-wide) installation

**Quick Mode** (with flags):
```bash
# Copy specific skill
ask copy gemini --skill bug-finder

# Copy all compatible skills to an agent
ask copy claude --all
```

### 2. List Available Skills
View your library of skills, including descriptions and supported agents.
```bash
ask list
```

### 3. Create a New Skill
**AI-Assisted** (Recommended):
Simply ask your AI agent to create a skill for you:
```
Create a new skill for Docker best practices

Make a skill that teaches REST API design

create new skill: explaining-code
Purpose: Explains code using analogies, ASCII diagrams, and step-by-step walkthroughs. Triggered by queries like "How does this work?"
Instructions emphasize conversational tone, multiple analogies, and highlighting common misconceptions.
```
*Prerequisites: Deploy `ask-skill-creator` to your agent first (see [Tooling Skills](#tooling-skills-meta-skills)).*

**Manual CLI** (Alternative):
Launch the interactive wizard to generate a standardized skill template.
```bash
ask create skill
```

### 4. Sync All Skills
Synchronize your entire skill library to all supported agents at once.
```bash
ask sync all
```

### 5. Add Support for New Agents
Want to use **Windsurf** or **Aider**? Use the scaffold wizard:
```bash
ask add-agent
```
This creates the necessary adapter code, making the new agent available instantly.

### Tooling Skills (Meta-Skills)

#### 🛠️ ask-skill-creator
**Description**: Teaches AI agents how to create skills for Agent Skill Kit

**How to Use**:
```bash
# Deploy to all agents so they can create skills
ask sync all
```

**Use Cases**:
- **AI-Assisted Skill Creation**: Let your AI agent create new skills by simply asking
  ```
  "Create a skill for API design best practices"
  ```
- Standardizing skill structure and format
- Automating skill scaffolding
- Building your custom skill library
- Teaching AI agents the skill creation workflow

**Example Workflow**:
1. Deploy this skill to your agent: `ask copy gemini --skill ask-skill-creator`
2. Ask your agent: "Create a skill called 'ask-docker-best-practices' for containerization guidelines"
3. The agent generates the skill files automatically

---

#### 🎯 ask-add-agent
**Description**: How to add support for new AI code editors to Agent Skill Kit

**How to Use**:
```bash
# Deploy to help your agent add new editor support
ask copy antigravity --skill ask-add-agent
```

**Use Cases**:
- **Extending ASK**: Add support for new AI editors (Windsurf, Aider, etc.)
- Creating custom agent adapters
- Understanding the agent adapter architecture
- Contributing new agent support to the project

**Example Workflow**:
1. Deploy this skill to your agent
2. Run the wizard: `ask add-agent`
3. Or ask your agent to help: "Add support for Windsurf editor"
4. The agent follows the documented process to create the adapter

---

#### 📄 ask-pdf-processing
**Description**: Handle PDF text extraction, form filling, and merging

**How to Use**:
```bash
ask copy antigravity --skill ask-pdf-processing
```

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting text from PDF documents
- Processing PDF forms
- Merging multiple PDFs
- PDF automation workflows

---

#### 🧠 ask-skill-capture
**Description**: Meta-skill. Analyzes the current session's lessons and saves them as a permanent reusable skill.

**How to Use**:
```bash
# Deploy to your agent (e.g., Antigravity, Gemini)
ask copy antigravity --skill ask-skill-capture
```

**Use Cases**:
- **Chat-to-Code**: Turn "messy" chat context into a structured skill
- **Constraint Capture**: Permanently save rules like "Always use FVM" or "Don't use Tailwind"
- **Workflow Automation**: Save a successful debugging sequence as a reusable protocol
- **Team Scaling**: Share tacit knowledge with your team via git-committed skills

**Example Workflow**:
1. You struggle through a task and finally get it right
2. You say: "Capture this as a skill called 'ask-deployment-protocol'"
3. The agent analyzes the conversation and generates the `SKILL.md`
4. You verify and save it

---

### 🚀 Quick Start with Skills

```bash
# View all available skills
ask list

# Deploy a specific skill to an agent
ask copy gemini --skill ask-bug-finder

# Deploy all compatible skills to an agent
ask copy claude --all

# Sync all skills to all agents
ask sync all

# Create your own skill (interactive)
ask create skill

# Or ask your AI agent to create one (if skill-creator is deployed)
"Create a new skill for API testing best practices"
```

## �📐 Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing:
*   **`skill.yaml`**: Metadata (name, description, tags, supported agents).
*   **`README.md`**: The actual prompt/instructions for the AI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Naming Convention**: All skill names must start with the `ask-` prefix (e.g., `ask-bug-finder`, `ask-commit-assistance`).

```yaml
# skill.yaml
name: ask-bug-finder
version: 1.0.0
category: coding
agents:
  - gemini
  - claude
  - cursor
```

## 🧩 Design Principles

1.  **Universal Definition**: Skills are defined in a neutral format that can be adapted to any agent.
2.  **Local-First, Global-Ready**: Prioritize project-specific skills (checked into git) while supporting user-wide global skills.
3.  **Safe by Default**: The CLI will **never** silently overwrite an existing skill. It always asks.
4.  **Agentic Workflow**: The toolkit includes skills (`skill-creator`) specifically designed to help AI agents help *you* build more skills.
