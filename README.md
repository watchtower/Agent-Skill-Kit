# Agent Skill Kit (ASK)

![Agent Skill Kit Banner](assets/banner.png)

**Agent Skill Kit (ASK)** is a CLI toolkit for managing, distributing, and syncing skills across multiple AI agents. It serves as a unified "package manager" for your AI's capabilities, allowing you to define a skill once and deploy it to **Gemini, Claude, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor**, and more.

## 🧠 Why Agent Skill Kit?

Managing instructions for multiple AI agents is tedious. You often have to:
*   Copy `.cursorrules` to `.codex.md`.
*   Manually sync `~/instructions.md` with project-specific prompts.
*   Format skills differently for Gemini (`SKILL.md`) vs Claude (Slash Commands).

**ASK** solves this by treating skills as **reusable packages**.
1. **Define Once**: Write a skill in a standard format.
2. **Deploy Anywhere**: ASK transforms and copies the skill to the correct location and format for each agent.
3. **Sync**: Keep all your agents updated with a single command.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Support**: Native support for Gemini, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Antigravity, and Cursor.
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatically discovers available agents in the `agents/` directory.
- **Safe Copy**: Strictly adheres to "Do Not Overwrite". Prompts for a new name if a skill conflicts.
- **Local & Global**: Choose between **Project-Local** (specific to one repo) or **Global** (user-wide) deployment.
- **AI-Assisted Creation**: Includes meta-skills that teach your AI how to create new skills (`skill-creator`) or add new agents (`add-agent`).
- **Extensible**: Add support for any new AI agent in seconds via the `ask add-agent` wizard.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NavanithanS/Agent-Skill-Kit.git
cd Agent-Skill-Kit

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

## 🛠 Usage

### 1. List Available Skills
View your library of skills, including descriptions and supported agents.
```bash
ask list
```

### 2. Create a New Skill
Launch the interactive wizard to generate a standardized skill template.
```bash
ask create skill
```
*Tip: After creating, ask your AI to "Improve this skill with best practices".*

### 3. Copy Skills to an Agent
Deploy a skill to a specific agent using the **interactive wizard** or use flags for quick access.

**Interactive Mode** (Recommended):
```bash
ask copy
```
The wizard guides you through:
1. **Skill Selection**: Beautiful table showing all skills with descriptions and categories
2. **Agent Selection**: Compatible agents highlighted for your chosen skill
3. **Destination**: Choose between local (project) or global (user-wide) installation

**Quick Mode** (with flags):
```bash
# Copy specific skill
ask copy gemini --skill bug-finder

# Copy all compatible skills
ask copy claude --all
```

### 4. Sync All Skills
Synchronize your entire skill library to all supported agents at once.
```bash
ask sync all
```

### 5. Add Support for New Agents
Want to use **Windsurf** or **Aider**? Use the scaffold wizard:
```bash
ask add-agent
```
This creates the necessary adapter code, making the new agent available instantly.

## 🎯 Supported Agents

| Agent | Local Path (Project) | Global Path (User) | Format |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------|--------|
| **Antigravity** | `.agent/skills/` | `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` | SKILL.md (YAML) |
| **Gemini CLI** | `.gemini/skills/` | `~/.gemini/skills/` | SKILL.md (YAML) |
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/commands/` | `~/.claude/commands/` | Markdown Command |
| **Codex** | `codex.md` | `~/.codex/instructions/` | Markdown |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/` | `~/.cursor/rules/` | Markdown Rules |

## 📐 Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing:
*   **`skill.yaml`**: Metadata (name, description, tags, supported agents).
*   **`README.md`**: The actual prompt/instructions for the AI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Naming Convention**: All skill names must start with the `ask-` prefix (e.g., `ask-bug-finder`, `ask-commit-assistance`).

```yaml
# skill.yaml
name: ask-bug-finder
version: 1.0.0
category: coding
agents:
  - gemini
  - claude
  - cursor
```

## 🧩 Design Principles

1.  **Universal Definition**: Skills are defined in a neutral format that can be adapted to any agent.
2.  **Local-First, Global-Ready**: Prioritize project-specific skills (checked into git) while supporting user-wide global skills.
3.  **Safe by Default**: The CLI will **never** silently overwrite an existing skill. It always asks.
4.  **Agentic Workflow**: The toolkit includes skills (`skill-creator`) specifically designed to help AI agents help *you* build more skills.
